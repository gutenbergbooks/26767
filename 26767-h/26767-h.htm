<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>A PROPHET.</h3>

  <p>What a curious book would be "Our Prophets and Enthusiasts!" The
  literary and biographical records of the vaticinators, and the heated
  spirits who, after working upon the fears of the timid, and exciting the
  imaginations of the weak, have flitted into oblivion! As a specimen of
  the odd characters such a work would embrace, allow me to introduce to
  your readers Thomas Newans, a Shropshire farmer, who unhappily took it
  into his head that his visit to the lower sphere was on a special
  mission.</p>

  <p>Mr. Newans is the author of a book entitled <i>A Key to the Prophecies
  of the Old and New Testament</i>; showing (among other impending events)
  "The approaching Invasion of England;" "The Extirpation of Popery and
  Mahometisme;" "The Restoration of the Jews," and "The Millennium."
  London: printed for the Author (who attests the genuineness of my copy by
  his signature), 1747.</p>

  <p>In this misfitted key he relates how, in a vision, he was invested
  with the prophetic mantle:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the year 1723, in the night," says Mr. Newans, "I fell into a
  dream, and seemed to be riding on the road into the county of Cheshire.
  When I was got about eight miles from home, my horse made a stop on the
  road; and it seemed a dark night, and on a sudden there shone a light
  before me on the ground, which was as bright as when the sun shines at
  noon-day. In the middle of that bright circle stood a child in white. It
  spoke, and told me that I must go into Cheshire, and I should find a man
  with uncommon marks upon his feet, which should be a warning to me to
  believe; and that the year after I should have a cow that would calve a
  calf with his heart growing out of his body in a wonderful manner, as a
  token of what should come to pass; and that a terrible war would break
  out in Europe, and in fourteen years after the token it would extend to
  England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In compliance with his supernatural communication, our farmer
  proceeded to Cheshire, where he found the man indicated; and, a year
  after, his own farm stock was increased by the birth of a calf with his
  heart growing out. And after taking his family, of seven, to witness to
  the truth of <!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page382"></a>{382}</span>what he describes, he adds with great
  simplicity: "So then I rode to London to acquaint the ministers of state
  of the approaching danger!"</p>

  <p>This story of the calf with the heart growing out, is not a bad type
  of the worthy grazier himself, and his <i>hearty</i> and burning zeal for
  the Protestant faith. Mr. Newans distinctly and repeatedly predicts that
  these "two beastly religions," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Popish and Mahomedan,
  will be totally extirpated within seven years! And "I have," says he,
  "for almost twenty years past, travelled to London and back again into
  the country, near fifty journies, and every journey was two hundred and
  fifty miles, to acquaint the ministers of state and several of the
  bishops, and other divines, with the certainty, danger, and manner of the
  war" which was to bring this about. Commenting on the story of Balaam,
  our prophet says: "And now the world is grown so full of sin and
  wickedness, that if a dumb ass should speak with a man's voice, they
  would scarce repent:" and I conclude that the said statesmen and divines
  did not estimate these prophetic warnings much higher than the brayings
  of that quadruped which they turned out to be. Mr. Newan professes to
  gave penned these vaticinations in the year 1744, twenty-one years after
  the date of his vision; so that he had ample time to mature them. What
  would the farmer say were he favoured with a peep at our world in 1853,
  with its Mussulman system unbroken; and its cardinal, archbishops, and
  Popish bishops firmly established in the very heart of Protestant
  England?</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Folk Lore in Cambridgeshire.</i>&mdash;About twenty years ago, at
  Hildersham, there was a custom of ringing the church bell at five o'clock
  in the leasing season. The cottagers then repaired to the fields to
  glean; but none went out before the bell was rung. The bell tolled again
  in the evening as a signal for all to return home. I would add a Query,
  Is this custom continued; and is it to be met with in any other
  place?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. M. Middleton.</span></p>

  <p><i>New Brunswick Folk Lore</i>:&mdash;<i>Common Notions respecting
  Teeth.</i>&mdash;Among the lower orders and negroes, and also among young
  children of respectable parents (who have probably derived the notion
  from contact with the others as nurses or servants), it is here very
  commonly held that when a tooth is drawn, if you refrain from thrusting
  the tongue in the cavity, the second tooth will be golden. Does this idea
  prevail in England?</p>

  <p><i>Superstition respecting Bridges.</i>&mdash;Many years ago my
  grandfather had quite a household of blacks, some of whom were slaves and
  some free. Being bred in his family, a large portion of my early days was
  thus passed among them, and I have often reverted to the weird
  superstitions with which they froze themselves and alarmed me. Most of
  these had allusion to the devil: scarcely one of them that I now
  recollect but referred to him. Among others they firmly held that when
  the clock struck twelve at midnight, the devil and a select company of
  his inferiors regularly came upon that part of the bridge called "the
  draw," and danced a hornpipe there. So firmly did they hold to this
  belief, that no threat nor persuasion could induce the stoutest-hearted
  of them to cross the fatal draw after ten o'clock at night. This belief
  is quite contrary to that which prevails in Scotland, according to which,
  Robin Burns being my authority, "neither witches nor any evil spirits
  have power to follow a poor wight any farther than the middle of the next
  running stream."<a name="footnotetag1"

  <p><i>North Lincolnshire Folk Lore.</i>&mdash;Here follow some shreds of
  folk lore which I have not seen as yet in "N. &amp; Q." They all belong
  to North Lincolnshire.</p>

  <p>1. Death sign. If a swarm of bees alight on a dead tree, or on the
  dead bough of a living tree, there will be a death in the family of the
  owner during the year.</p>

  <p>2. If you do not throw salt into the fire before you begin to churn,
  the butter will not come.</p>

  <p>3. If eggs are brought over running water they will have no chicks in
  them.</p>

  <p>4. It is unlucky to bring eggs into the house after sunset.</p>

  <p>5. If you wear a snake's skin round your head you will never have the
  headache.</p>

  <p>6. Persons called Agnes always go mad.</p>

  <p>7. A person who is born on Christmas Day will be able to see
  spirits.</p>

  <p>8. Never burn egg-shells; if you do, the hens cease to lay.</p>

  <p>9. If a pigeon is seen sitting in a tree, or comes into the house, or
  from being wild suddenly becomes tame, it is a sign of death.</p>

  <p>10. When you see a magpie you should cross yourself; if you do not you
  will be unlucky.</p>

<h3>POPE AND COWPER.</h3>

  <p>In Cowper's letter to Lady Hesketh, dated January 18, 1787, occurs a
  notice for the first time of Mr. Samuel Rose, with whom Cowper
  subsequently corresponded. He informs Lady Hesketh that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A young gentleman called here yesterday, who came six miles out of
  his way to see me. He was on a journey to London from Glasgow, having
  just left the University there. He came, I suppose, partly to satisfy his
  own curiosity, but chiefly, as it seemed, to bring me the thanks of some
  of the Scotch professors for my two volumes. His name is Rose, an
  Englishman."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Prefixed to a copy of Hayley's <i>Life and Letters of William Cowper,
  Esq.</i>, in the British Museum, is an extract in MS. of a letter from
  the late Samuel Rose, Esq., to his favourite sister, Miss Harriet Rose,
  written in the year before his marriage, at the age of twenty-two, and
  which, I believe, has never been printed. It may, perhaps, merit a corner
  of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p class="author">"Weston Lodge, Sept. 9, 1789.</p>

  <p>"Last week Mr. Cowper finished the <i>Odyssey</i>, and we drank an
  unreluctant bumper to its success. The labour of translation is now at an
  end, and the less arduous work of revision remains to be done, and then
  we shall see it published. I promise both you and myself much pleasure
  from its perusal. You will most probably find it at first less pleasing
  than Pope's versification, owing to the difference subsisting between
  blank verse and rhyme&mdash;a difference which is not sufficiently
  attended to, and whereby people are led into injudicious comparisons. You
  will find Mr. Pope more refined: Mr. Cowper more simple, grand, and
  majestic; and, indeed, insomuch as Mr. Pope is more refined than Mr.
  Cowper, he is more refined than his original, and in the same proportion
  departs from Homer himself. Pope's must universally be allowed to be a
  beautiful poem: Mr. Cowper's will be found a striking and a faithful
  portrait, and a pleasing picture to those who enjoy his style of
  colouring, which I am apprehensive is not so generally acceptable as the
  other master's. Pope possesses the gentle and amiable graces of a Guido:
  Cowper is endowed with the bold sublime genius of a Raphael. After having
  said so much upon their comparative merits, enough, I hope, to refute
  your second assertion which was, that women, in the opinion of men, have
  little to do with literature. I may inform you, that the <i>Iliad</i> is
  to be dedicated to Earl Cowper, and the <i>Odyssey</i> to the Dowager
  Lady Spencer but this information need not be extensively
  circulated."</p>

  <p>It would have only occupied your space needlessly, to have transcribed

  Shakspeare's <i>As You Like It</i>; but I would solicit the attention of
  your readers to the Latin verses, and then to the question, Whether
  either poet has borrowed from the other? and, should this be decided
  affirmatively, the farther question would arise, Which is the
  original?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Arterus.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[These lines look like a modern paraphrase of Shakspeare; and our
  Correspondent has not informed us from what book he has
  <i>transcribed</i> them.&mdash;Ed.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Passage in "King John" and "Romeo and Juliet."</i>&mdash;I am
  neither a commentator nor a reader of commentators on Shakspeare. When I
  meet with a difficulty, I get over it as well as I can, and think no more
  of the matter. Having, however, accidentally seen two passages of
  Shakspeare much ventilated in "N. &amp; Q.," I venture to give my poor
  conjectures respecting them.</p>

  <p>1. <i>King John.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It lies as sightly on the back of him,</p>
      <p>As great Alcides' <i>shows</i> upon an ass."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I consider <i>shows</i> to be the true reading; the reference being to
  the ancient <i>mysteries</i>, called also <i>shows</i>. The machinery
  required for the celebration of the mysteries was carried by
  <i>asses</i>. Hence the proverb: "Asinus portat mysteriæ." The connexion
  of Hercules&mdash;"great Alcides"&mdash;with the mysteries, may be
  learned from Aristophanes and many other ancient writers. And thus the
  meaning of the passage seems to be: The lion's skin, which once belonged
  to Richard of the Lion Heart, is as sightly on the back of
  <i>Austria</i>, as were the mysteries of Hercules upon an ass.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That runaways eyes may wink."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here I would retain the reading, and interpret <i>runaways</i> as
  signifying "persons going about on the watch." Perhaps <i>runagates</i>,
  according to modern usage, would come nearer to the proposed
  signification, but not to be quite up with it. Many words in Shakspeare
  have significations very remote from those which they now bear.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Patrick Muirson.</span></p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare and the Bible.</i>&mdash;Has it ever been noticed that
  the following passage from the Second Part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, Act I.
  Sc. 3., is taken from the fourteenth chapter of St. Luke's Gospel?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What do we then, but draw anew the model</p>
      <p>In fewer offices; or, at least, desist</p>
      <p>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</p>
      <p>(Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down,</p>
      <p>And set another up) should we survey</p>
      <p>The plot, the situation, and the model;</p>
      <p>Consult upon a sure foundation,</p>
      <p>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</p>
      <p>How able such a work to undergo.</p>
      <p>A careful leader sums what force he brings</p>
      <p>To weigh against his opposite; or else</p>
      <p>We fortify on paper, and in figures,</p>
      <p>Using the names of men, instead of men:</p>
      <p>Like one that draws the model of a house</p>
      <p>Beyond his power to build it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The passage in St. Luke is as follows (xiv. 28-31.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first,
  and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</p>

  <p>"Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to
  finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</p>

  <p>"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</p>

  <p>"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not
  down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet
  him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I give the passage as altered by Mr. Collier's Emendator, because I
  think the line added by him,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A careful leader sums what force he brings,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>is strongly corroborated by the Scripture text.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Judicial Families.</i>&mdash;In vol. v. p. 206. (new edition) of
  Lord Mahon's <i>History of England</i>, we find the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lord Chancellor Camden was the younger son of Chief Justice
  Pratt,&mdash;a case of rare succession in the annals of the law, and not
  easily matched, unless by their own cotemporaries, Lord Hardwicke and
  Charles Yorke."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following case, I think, is equally, if not more,
  remarkable:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Right Hon. Thomas Berry Cusack-Smith, brother of the present Sir
  Michael Cusack-Smith, Bart., is Master of the Rolls in Ireland, having
  been appointed to that high office in January, 1846. His father, Sir
  William Cusack-Smith, second baronet, was for many years Baron of the
  Court of Exchequer in Ireland. And his grandfather, the Right Hon. Sir
  Michael Smith, first baronet, was, like his grandson at the present day,
  Master of the Rolls in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Is not this "a case of rare succession in the annals of the law, and
  not easily matched?"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Abhba.</span></p>

<p><!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>{385}</span></p>

  <p><i>Derivation of "Topsy Turvy."</i>&mdash;When things are in confusion
  they are generally said to be turned "topsy turvy." The expression is
  derived from a way in which turf for fuel is placed to dry on its being
  cut. The surface of the ground is pared off with the heath growing on it,
  and the heath is turned downward, and left some days in that state that
  the earth may get dry before it is carried away. It means then
  top-side-turf-way.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Clericus Rusticus</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Dictionaries and Encyclopædias.</i>&mdash;Allow me to offer a
  suggestion to the publishers and compilers of dictionaries; first as to
  dictionaries of the language. A large class refer to these only to learn
  the meaning of words not familiar to them, but which may occur in
  reading. If the dictionaries are framed on the principle of displaying
  only the classical language of England, it is ten to one they will not
  supply the desired information. Let there be, besides classical
  dictionaries, glossaries which will exclude no word whatever on account
  of rarity, vulgarity, or technicality, but which may very well exclude
  those which are most familiar. As to encyclopædias, their value is
  chiefly as supplements to the library; but surely no one studies anatomy,
  or the differential calculus, or architecture, in them, however good the
  treatises may be. I want a dictionary of miscellaneous subjects, such as
  find place more easily in an encyclopædia than anywhere else; but why
  must I also purchase treatises on the higher mathematics, on navigation,
  on practical engineering, and the like, some of which I already may
  possess, others not want, and none of which are a bit the more convenient
  because arranged in alphabetical order in great volumes. Besides, they
  cannot be conveniently replaced by improved editions.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Encyclopædicus</span>.</p>

  <p><i>"Mary, weep no more for me."</i>&mdash;There is a well-known ballad
  of this name, said to have been written by a Scotchman named "Low." The
  first verse runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The moon had climbed the highest hill,</p>
      <p>Which rises o'er the source of Dee,</p>
      <p>And from the eastern summit sped</p>
      <p>Its silver light on tower and tree."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I find, however, amongst my papers, a fragment of a version of this
  same ballad, of, I assume, earlier antiquity, which so surpasses Low's
  ballad that the author has little to thank him for his interference. The
  first verse of what I take to be the original poem stands thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The moon had climbed the highest hill,</p>
      <p>Where eagles big<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> aboon the Dee,</p>
      <p>And like the looks of a lovely dame,</p>
      <p>Brought joy to every body's ee."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>No poetical reader will require his attention to be directed to the
  immeasurable superiority of this glorious verse: the high poetic
  animation, the eagles' visits, the lovely looks of female beauty, the
  exhilarating gladness and joy affecting the beholder, all manifest the
  genius of the master bard. I shall receive it as a favour if any of your
  correspondents will furnish a complete copy of the original poem, and
  contrast it with what "Low" fancied his "improvements."</p>

  <p><i>Epitaph at Wood Ditton.</i>&mdash;You have recently appropriated a
  small space in your "medium of intercommunication" to the subject of
  epitaphs. I can furnish you with one which I have been accustomed to
  regard as a "grand climacterical absurdity." About thirty years ago, when
  making a short summer ramble, I entered the churchyard of Wood Ditton,
  near Newmarket, and my attention was attracted by a headstone, having
  inlaid into its upper part a piece of iron, measuring about ten inches by
  six, and hollowed out into the shape of a <i>dish</i>. I inquired of a
  cottager residing on the spot what the thing meant? I was informed that
  the party whose ashes the grave covered was a man who, during a long
  life, had a strange taste for sopping a slice of bread in a dripping-pan
  (a pan over which meat has been roasted), and would relinquish for this
  all kinds of dishes, sweet or savoury; that in his will he left a request
  that a dripping-pan should be fixed in his gravestone; that he wrote his
  own epitaph, an exact copy of which I herewith give you, and which he
  requested to be engraved on the stone:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Here lies my corpse, who was the man</p>
      <p>That loved a sop in the dripping-pan;</p>
      <p>But now believe me I am dead,&mdash;</p>
      <p>See here the pan stands at my head.</p>
      <p>Still for sops till the last I cried,</p>
      <p>But could not eat, and so I died.</p>
      <p>My neighbours they perhaps will laugh,</p>
      <p>When they read my epitaph."</p>

<h3>SIR THOMAS BUTTON'S VOYAGE, 1612.</h3>

  <p>I am about to print some information, hitherto I believe totally
  unknown, relative to the voyage of Sir Thomas Button in 1612, for the
  discovery of the north-west passage.</p>

  <p>Of this voyage a journal was kept, which was in existence many years
  afterwards, being offered by <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  1629, then engaged in forwarding the projected voyage of "North-West"
  Foxe; it is remarkable, however, that no extended account of this voyage,
  so important in its objects, has ever been published. I am desirous of
  knowing if this journal is in existence, and where? Also, Lord
  Dorchester's letter to Button in February, 1629; of any farther
  information on the subject of the voyage, or of Sir Thomas Button.</p>

  <p>What I possess already are, 1. "Motiues inducing a Proiect for the
  Discouerie of the North Pole terrestriall; the streights of Anian, into
  the South Sea, and Coasts thereof," anno 1610. 2. Prince Henry's
  Instructions for the Voyage, together with King James's Letters of
  Credence, 1612. 3. A Letter from Sir Thomas Button to Secretary
  Dorchester, dated Cardiff, 16th Feb., 1629 (from the State Paper Office).
  4. Sir Dudley Digges' little tract on the N.-W. Passage, written to
  promote the voyage, and of which there were two distinct impressions in
  1611 and 1612. 5. Extracts from the Carleton Correspondence, and from the
  Hakluyt Society's volume on Voyages to the North-West.</p>

  <p>I shall be glad also to learn the date, and any other facts connected
  with the death of John Davis, the discoverer of the Straits bearing his
  name.</p>

  <p><i>Cawdrey's "Treasure of Similes."</i>&mdash;I stumbled lately at a
  book-stall on a very curious old book entitled <i>A Treasurie or
  Store-house of Similes both pleasant, delightfull, and profitable</i>.
  The title-page is gone; but in an old hand on the cover it is stated to
  have been written by a certain "Cawdrey," and to have been printed in
  1609, where I cannot discover. Can any of your correspondents oblige me
  with some information concerning him? The book is marked "scarce."</p>

  <p><i>Napoleon's Spelling.</i>&mdash;Macaulay, in his <i>History of
  England</i>, chap. vii., quotes, in a foot-note, a passage from a letter
  of William III., written in French to his ambassador at Paris, and then
  makes this remark, "The spelling is bad, but not worse than Napoleon's."
  <!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Can you refer me to some authentic proof of the fact that Napoleon was
  unable to spell correctly? It is well known that he affected to put his
  thoughts upon paper with great rapidity; and the consequence of this
  practice was, that in almost every word some letters were dropped, or
  their places indicated by dashes. But this was only one of those numerous
  contrivances, to which he was in the habit of resorting, in order to
  impress those around him with an idea of his greatness.</p>

  is also to be met with in many places. As these signs evidently had their

  "The Blue Bell of Scotland," it seems to me that the best method to apply
  for information upon the subject is to ask "N. &amp; Q." Are these signs
  of inns heraldic survivors of old time; are they corruptions of some
  other emblem, such as that which in London transformed <i>La Belle
  Sauvage</i> into the <i>Bell Savage</i>, pictorialised by an Indian
  ringing a hand-bell; or is the choice of such improper colour as blue for
  a bell and an anchor a species of symbolism the meaning of which is not

  Esq., Deputy Secretary of War for many years under the Right Hon. William
  Windham, then M.P. for Norwich, and other Secretaries-at-War. I rather
  think Mr. Lewis married a daughter of Sir Thomas Sewell, Kt., Master of
  the Rolls from 1764 to 1784; and had a son, Matthew Gregory Lewis, known
  as <i>Monk</i> Lewis, who was M.P. for Hindon at the close of the last
  century: a very clever but eccentric young man. I also believe
  Lieut.-Gen. John Whitelocke, and Gen. Sir Thos. Brownrigg, G.C.B., who

  <p><i>Paradise Lost.</i>&mdash;In <i>A Treatise on the Dramatic

  following remark:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In our own literature also, the efforts of our early dramatists were
  directed to subjects derived from religion; even the <i>Paradise Lost</i>
  is composed of a series of minor pieces, originally cast in dramatic
  form, of which the creation and fall of man, and the several episodes
  which were introduced subordinately to these grand events, were the
  subject-matter."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This statement being at variance with the received opinion, that
  Milton, from his early youth, had meditated the composition of an epic
  poem, I would inquire whether there is any evidence to support Mr.
  Darley's view? Milton has been charged with having borrowed the design of
  <i>Paradise Lost</i> from some Italian author; and this allegation,
  coupled with that made by Mr. Darley, would, if founded, reduce our great
  national epic to what Hazlitt has described as "patchwork and plagiarism,
  the beggarly copiousness of borrowed wealth."</p>

  to a deed of Henry III.'s times made between Robert de Grendon, Lord of
  Shenston, and Jno. de Baggenhall; which family of Gresebrok, it is said,
  "probably took their name from a <i>manor so called in Yorkshire</i>, and
  had property and residence in Shenstone, from this early period to the
  beginning of the century, many of whom are recorded in the registers from
  1590 to 1722."</p>

  speediest way to reform the same."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The commission thus appointed consisted twenty-one persons, among whom

  seem to have set to work with great vigour, and submitted a variety of
  important measures to Parliament, many of which were <!-- Page 390

  also prepared a document "containing the whole system of the law," which

  "That three hundred copies of the said book be forthwith printed, to be

  <p><i>Saint Malachy on the Popes.</i>&mdash;Saint Malachy, Archbishop of

  II. <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1143, to that of Innocent X. <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1644. The present Pope being the nineteenth from

  exclusively exemplified by passages from Ambrose Philips:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This [says Pope] is when a poet grows so very simple as to think and
  talk like a child. I shall take my examples from the greatest master in
  this way: hear how he fondles like a mere stammerer:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These verses are stated by Warburton, in his note on the passage, to
  be taken from a poem to <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page391"></a>{391}</span>Miss Cuzzona. They are however in fact
  selected from two poems addressed to daughters of Lord Carteret, and are
  put together arbitrarily, out of the order in which they stand in the
  original poems. There is a short poem by Philips in the same metre,
  addressed to Signora Cuzzoni, and dated May 25, 1724, beginning, "Little
  syren of the stage;" but none of the verses quoted in the <i>Treatise on
  the Bathos</i> are extracted from it.</p>

  <p><i>Namby-pamby</i> belongs to a tolerably numerous class of words in
  our language, all formed on the same rhyming principle. They are all
  familiar, and some of them childish; which last circumstance probably
  suggested to Pope the invention of the word <i>namby-pamby</i>, in order
  to designate the infantine style which Ambrose Philips had introduced.
  Many of them, however, are used by old and approved writers; and the
  principle upon which they are formed must be of great antiquity in our
  language. The following is a collection of words which are all formed in
  this manner:</p>

  <p><i>Bow-wow.</i>&mdash;A word coined in imitation of a dog's bark.
  Compare the French <i>aboyer</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chit-chat.</i>&mdash;Formed by reduplication from <i>chat</i>. A
  word (says Johnson) used in ludicrous conversation. It occurs in the
  <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Tatler</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fiddle-faddle.</i>&mdash;Formed in a similar manner from <i>to
  fiddle</i>, in its sense of <i>to trifle</i>. It occurs in the
  <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Flim-flam.</i>&mdash;An old word, of which examples are cited from
  Beaumont and Fletcher, and Swift. It is formed from <i>flam</i>, which
  Johnson calls "a cant word of no certain etymology." <i>Flam</i>, for a
  lie, a cheat, is however used by South, Barrow, and Warburton, and
  therefore at one time obtained an admission into dignified style. See
  Nares' <i>Glossary</i> in v.</p>

  <p><i>Hab or nab.</i>&mdash;That is, according to Nares, have or have
  not; subsequently abridged into <i>hab, nab</i>. <i>Hob or nob</i> is
  explained by him to mean "Will you have a glass of wine or not?" <i>Hob,
  nob</i> is applied by Shakspeare to another alternative, viz. give or
  take (<i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act III. Sc. 4.). See Nares in v. <i>Habbe or
  Nabbe</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Handy-dandy.</i>&mdash;"A play in which children change hands and
  places" (Johnson). Formed from hand. The word is used by Shakspeare.</p>

  <p><i>Harum-scarum.</i>&mdash;"A low but frequent expression applied to
  flighty persons; persons always in a hurry" (Todd). Various conjectures
  are offered respecting its origin: the most probable seems to be, that it
  is derived from <i>scare</i>. The Anglo-Saxon word <i>hearmsceare</i>
  means punishment (see Grimm, <i>Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer</i>, p. 681.);
  but although the similarity of sound is remarkable, it is difficult to
  understand how <i>harum-scarum</i> can be connected with it.</p>

  <p><i>Helter-skelter.</i>&mdash;Used by Shakspeare. Several derivations
  for this word are suggested, but none probable.</p>

  <p><i>Higgledy-piggledy.</i>&mdash;"A cant word, corrupted from
  <i>higgle</i>, which denotes any confused mass, as <i>higglers</i> carry
  a huddle of provisions together" (Johnson). It seems more probable that
  the word is formed from <i>pig</i>; and that it alludes to the confused
  and indiscriminate manner in which pigs lie together. In other instances
  (as <i>chit-chat</i>, <i>flim-flam</i>, <i>pit-a-pat</i>,
  <i>shilly-shally</i>, <i>slip-slop</i>, and perhaps <i>harum-scarum</i>),
  the word which forms the basis of the rhyming reduplication stands
  second, and not first.</p>

  <p><i>Hocus-pocus.</i>&mdash;The words <i>ocus bochus</i> appear, from a
  passage cited in Todd, to have been used anciently by Italian conjurers.
  The fanciful idea of Tillotson, that <i>hocus-pocus</i> is a corruption
  of the words <i>hoc est corpus</i>, is well known. Compare Richardson
  <i>in v.</i></p>

  <p><i>Hoddy-doddy.</i>&mdash;This ancient word has various meanings (see
  Richardson <i>in v.</i>). As used by Ben Jonson and Swift, it is
  expressive of contempt. In Holland's translation of Pliny it signifies a
  snail. There is likewise a nursery rhyme or riddle:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Hoddy-doddy,</p>
      <p>All legs and no body."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Hodge-podge</i> appears to be a corruption of <i>hotch-pot</i>. It
  occurs in old writers. (See Richardson in <i>Hotch-pot</i>.)</p>

  <p><i>Hoity-toity.</i>&mdash;Thoughtless, giddy. Formed from the old word
  <i>to hoit</i>, to dance or leap, to indulge in riotous mirth. See Nares
  in <i>Hoit</i> and <i>Hoyt</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Hubble-bubble.</i>&mdash;A familiar word, formed from
  <i>bubble</i>. Not in the dictionaries.</p>

  <p><i>Hubbub.</i>&mdash;Used by Spenser, and other good writers.
  Richardson derives it from <i>hoop</i> or <i>whoop</i>, shout or yell. It
  seems rather a word formed in imitation of the confused inarticulate
  noise produced by the mixture of numerous voices, like <i>mur-mur</i> in
  Latin.</p>

  <p><i>Hugger-mugger.</i>&mdash;Used by Spenser, Shakspeare, and other old
  writers. The etymology is uncertain. Compare Jamieson in
  <i>Hudge-mudge</i>. The latter part of the word seems to be allied with
  <i>smuggle</i>, and the former part to be the reduplication. The original
  and proper sense of hugger-mugger is secretly. See Nares <i>in v.</i>,
  who derives it from <i>to hugger</i>, to lurk about; but query whether
  such a word can be shown to have existed?</p>

  <p><i>Humpty-dumpty.</i>&mdash;Formed from <i>hump</i>. This word occurs
  in the nursery rhyme:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Humpty-dumpty</i> sat on a wall,</p>
      <p><i>Humpty-dumpty</i> had a great fall," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Hurdy-gurdy.</i>&mdash;The origin of this word, which is quoted
  from no writer earlier than Foote, has not been explained. See Todd <i>in
  v.</i></p>

  <p><i>Hurly-burly.</i>&mdash;This old word occurs in the well-known
  verses in the opening scene of <i>Macbeth</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When the <i>hurly burly's</i> done,</p>
      <p>When the battle's lost and won"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span></p>

  <p>where see the notes of the commentators for other instances of it.
  There are rival etymologies for this word, but all uncertain. The French
  has <i>hurlu-burlu</i>. Nares in <i>Hurly</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Hurry-scurry.</i>&mdash;This word, formed from <i>hurry</i>, is
  used by Gray in his <i>Long Story</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Nick-nack.</i>&mdash;A small ornament. Not in the dictionaries.</p>

  <p><i>Pic-nic.</i>&mdash;For the derivation of this word, which seems to
  be of French origin, see "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., pp. 240. 387.</p>

  <p><i>Pit-pat, or Pit-a-pat.</i>&mdash;A word formed from <i>pat</i>, and
  particularly applied to the pulsations of the heart, when accelerated by
  emotion. Used by Ben Jonson and Dryden. Congreve writes it
  <i>a-pit-pat</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Riff-raff.</i>&mdash;The refuse of anything, "Il ne lui lairra rif
  ny raf." Cotgrave in <i>Rif</i>, where <i>rif</i> is said to mean
  nothing.</p>

  <p><i>Rolly-pooly.</i>&mdash;"A sort of game" (Johnson). It is now used
  as the name of a pudding rolled with sweetmeat.</p>

  <p><i>Rowdy-dowdy, and Rub-a-dub.</i>&mdash;Words formed in imitation of
  the beat of a drum.</p>

  <p><i>Shilly-shally.</i>&mdash;Used by Congreve, and formerly written
  "shill I, shall I."</p>

  <p><i>Slip-slop.</i>&mdash;"Bad liquor. A low word, formed by
  reduplication of <i>slop</i>" (Johnson). Now generally applied to errors
  in pronunciation, arising from ignorance and carelessness, like those of
  Mrs. Malaprop in <i>The Rivals</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Tip-top.</i>&mdash;Formed from <i>top</i>, like <i>slip-slop</i>
  from <i>slop</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Tirra-lirra.</i>&mdash;Used by Shakspeare:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The lark that <i>tirra lirra</i> chants."&mdash;<i>Winter's Tale</i>, Act IV. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From the French, see Nares <i>in v.</i></p>

  <p>The preceding collection is intended merely to illustrate the
  principle upon which this class of words are formed, and does not aim at
  completeness. Some of your correspondents will doubtless, if they are

<h3>EARL OF OXFORD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 292.)</p>

  <p>S. N. will find the Earl's answer in a volume, not very common now,
  entitled <i>A Compleat and Impartial History of the Impeachments of the
  Last Ministry</i>, London, 8vo., 1716. The charge respecting the creation
  of twelve peers in one day formed the 16th article of the impeachment. I
  inclose a copy of the answer, if not too long for your pages.</p>

  <p class="author">G.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In answer to the 16th article, the said Earl doth insist, that by the
  laws and constitution of this realm, it is the undoubted right and
  prerogative of the Sovereign, who is the fountain of honor, to create
  peers of this realm, as well in time of Parliament as when there is no
  Parliament sitting or in being; and that the exercise of this branch of
  the prerogative is declared in the form or preamble of all patents of
  honor, to proceed <i>ex mero motu</i>, as an act of mere grace and favor,
  and that such acts are not done as many other acts of public nature are,
  by and with the advice of the Privy Council; or as acts of pardon usually
  run, upon a favorable representation of several circumstances, or upon
  reports from the Attorney-General or other officers, that such acts are
  lawful or expedient, or for the safety or advantage of the Crown; but
  flows entirely from the beneficent and gracious disposition of the
  Sovereign. He farther says, that neither the warrants for patents of
  honor, the bills or other engrossments of such patents, are at any time
  communicated to the council or the treasury, as several other patents
  are; and therefore the said Earl, either as High Treasurer or Privy
  Councillor, could not have any knowledge of the same: Nevertheless, if
  her late sacred Majesty had thought fit to acquaint him with her most
  gracious intentions of creating any number of peers of this realm, and
  had asked his opinion, whether the persons whom she then intended to
  create were persons proper to have been promoted to that dignity, he does
  believe he should have highly approved her Majesty's choice; and does not
  apprehend that in so doing he had been guilty of any breach of his duty,
  or violation of the trust in him reposed; since they were all persons of
  honor and distinguished merit, and the peerage thereby was not greatly
  increased, considering some of those created would have been peers by
  descent, and many noble families were then lately extinct: And the said
  Earl believes many instances may be given where this prerogative hath
  been exercised by former princes of this realm, in as extensive a manner;
  and particularly in the reigns of King Henry the Eighth, King James the
  First, and his late Majesty King William. The said Earl begs leave to
  add, that in the whole course of his life he hath always loved the
  established constitution, and in his private capacity as well as in all
  public stations, when he had the honor to be employed, has ever done his
  utmost to preserve it, and shall always continue so to do."</p>

<h3>PICTS' HOUSES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 264.)</p>

  <p>The mention there made of the recent discovery of one of these
  subterranean vaults or passages in Aberdeenshire, induces me to ask a
  question in regard to two subterranean passages which have lately been
  discovered in Berwickshire, and which so far differ from all others that
  I have heard or read of, that whereas all of them seem to have been built
  at the sides with large flat stones, and roofed with similar ones, and
  then covered with earth, those which I am about to mention are both hewn
  out of the solid rock. They are both situated in the Lammermoor range of
  hills. Those persons who have seen them are at a loss to know for what
  <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>{393}</span>purpose they could have been excavated,
  unless for the purpose of sepulture in the times of the aborigines, or of
  very early inhabitants of Britain, as they in many respects resemble
  those stone graves which are mentioned in Worsaae's <i>Description of the
  Primæval Antiquities of Denmark</i>, translated and applied to the
  illustration of similar remains in England by Mr. Thoms.</p>

  <p>One of these cavities is situated on a remote pasture farm, among the
  hills belonging to the Earl of Lauderdale, called Braidshawrigg; and was
  discovered by a shepherd very near his own house, within less than a
  quarter of a mile up a small stream which runs past it, and on the
  opposite side of the water, a few yards up the steep hill. The shepherd
  had observed for some time that one of his dogs was in the habit of going
  into what he supposed to be a rabbit hole at this place, and when he was
  missing and called, he generally came out of this hole. At last,
  curiosity led his master to take a spade and dig into it; and he soon
  found that, after digging down into the soil to the rock, the cavity
  became larger, and had evidently been the work of human hands.
  Information was given to Lord Lauderdale, and the rubbish was cleared
  away. It (the rubbish) did not extend far in, and after that the passage
  was clear. The excavation consists of a passage cut nearly north and
  south (the entrance being to the south) through various strata of solid
  rocks, partly grauwacke, (or what is there called <i>whinstone</i>), and
  partly grey slate: the strata lying east and west, and nearly vertical.
  The whole length of it is seventy-four feet. From the entrance the
  passage, for four or five yards, slopes downwards into the hill; it then
  runs horizontally the length of sixty-three feet from the entrance, when
  it changes its direction at right angles to the westward for a distance
  of eleven feet; when it ends with the solid rock. It is regularly from
  three feet four inches to three feet six inches wide, and about seven
  feet high, the ceiling being somewhat circular. The floor is the rock cut
  square. The time and labour must have been great to cut this passage, as
  not more than one man could conveniently quarry the rock at the same
  time. It might have been supposed that this was a level to a mine, as
  copper has been worked in this range farther eastward; but the passage
  does not follow any vein, but cuts across all the strata, and keeps a
  straight line, till it turns westward, and then in another straight line;
  and the floors, sides, and roof are all made quite regular and even with
  a pickaxe or a hammer. There does not appear to have been at any time any
  other habitation than the shepherd's house, and another cottage a little
  lower down the stream, in the neighbourhood. The discovery of this cavern
  recalled to the recollection of myself, and some of my family, that a few
  years ago, in cutting a road through the rock into a whinstone quarry,
  about four miles south of Braidshawrigg, near a mill, we had cut across
  the east end of a passage somewhat similar to the one before mentioned,
  but running east and west; that we had cleared it out for a short way,
  but as it then went under a corner of one of the houses belonging to the
  mill, we stopped, for fear of bringing down the building, as this
  passage, though cut out of the solid rock, was not a mine, but had been
  worked to the surface; and, if it ever had been used for purposes of
  sepulture, must have been roofed with flagstones, and then covered with
  earth like other Picts' houses. But these roof-stones must have been
  carried away, and the whole trench was filled with rubbish, and all trace
  of it on the surface was obliterated. This passage we have lately opened,
  and cleared out. To the westward it passes into the adjoining water-mill,
  which is itself in great part formed by excavation of the rock; and the
  east wall of the upper part of the mill is arched over the passage.
  Beyond the west wall of the mill which adjoins the stream, there is a
  continuation of the trench through the rock down to the water, which
  serves to take away that which passes over the millwheel at right angles
  to where the rock has been cut away to make room for the millwheel
  itself. That which has been cut away in making the trench, is a seam of
  clay slate about three feet six inches in breadth, between two solid
  whinstone rocks. The length of the passage, from the east end, which
  terminated in rock, to the mill, is sixty-three feet. The mill is thirty
  feet, and the cut beyond it twelve feet: in all, one hundred and five
  feet. The average depth is about twelve feet; but as it slopes down to
  the stream, some of it is sixteen feet deep. It has been suggested that
  it might have been dug out in order to obtain the coarse slate; but the
  difficulty of working a confined seam like this, in any other way than by
  picking it out piecemeal with immense labour, seems impossible. It can
  never have been meant to convey water to the mill, as the highest part
  begins in the solid rock, and the object must always have been to keep
  the water on the highest possible level, until it reached the top of the
  millwheel. Nothing was found in either of these excavations.&mdash;After
  this long discussion, Query, What can have been the purpose for which
  these laborious works can have been executed?</p>

<h3>PRONUNCIATION OF "HUMBLE."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 229. 298.)</p>

  <p>It is my misfortune entirely to differ from <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dawson</span> (p. 229.) and <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> (p.
  298.) as to the pronunciation of <i>humble</i>; and permit me to say
  (with all courtesy) that I was unfeignedly surprised at the latter's
  assertion, that sounding <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page394"></a>{394}</span>the <i>h</i> is "a recent attempt to
  introduce a mispronunciation," as I have known that mode of pronunciation
  all but universally prevalent for nearly the last forty years; and I have
  had pretty good opportunities for observing what the general usage in
  that respect was, as I was for some years at a very large public school,
  then at Oxford for more than the usual time, and have since resided in
  London more than twenty-five years, practising as a barrister in
  Westminster Hall, and on one of the largest circuits. If, therefore, I
  have not had ample means of judging as to the pronunciation of
  <i>humble</i>, I know not where the means are to be found; especially as
  I doubt whether <i>humble</i> and <i>humbly</i> are anywhere so
  frequently used as in courts: a counsel rarely making a speech without
  "<i>humbly</i> submitting" or making a "<i>humble</i> application." Now
  the result of my experience is, that the <i>h</i> is almost universally
  sounded; and at this moment I cannot call to mind a single gentleman who
  omits it, who does not also omit it in many other instances where no
  doubt can exist that it ought to be sounded.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Dawson</span> believes the sounding the <i>h</i>
  to be "one of those, either Oxford, or Cambridge, or both, peculiarities
  of which no reasonable explanation can be given." Now I believe <span
  class="sc">Mr. Dawson</span> is right in supposing that that usage is
  general both at Oxford and Cambridge, and I rather think that not only an
  explanation of the fact may be given, but that the fact itself, that in
  both the Universities the <i>h</i> is sounded, is extremely cogent
  evidence that it is correct. It cannot be doubted that the fact that a
  word is spelled with certain letters is clear proof that, at the time
  when that spelling was adopted, the word was so sounded as to give a
  distinct sound to each of the letters used, and that clearly must have
  been the case with words beginning with <i>h</i> especially. When,
  therefore, the present spelling of <i>humble</i> was adopted, the
  <i>h</i> was sounded. Now, whilst I freely admit that the utterance of
  any word may be changed&mdash;"Si volet usus, quem penes arbitrium est,
  et jus et norma loquendi"&mdash;still it cannot be questioned that the
  usage must be so general, clear, and distinct among the better educated
  classes (where-ever they may have received their education) as to leave
  no reasonable doubt about the matter; and that it lies on those who
  assert that such a change has taken place, to show such a usage as I have
  mentioned. And when the number of the members of the Universities is
  considered, and their position as men of education, it must at least
  admit of doubt whether, if a general usage prevailed among them to
  pronounce a particular word in the manner in which it originally was
  pronounced, this would not alone prevent a different pronunciation among
  others from having that general prevalence, which would be sufficient to
  justify a change in the utterance of such word.</p>

  <p>But let us consider whether the usage of the Universities is not very
  cogent evidence that the <i>h</i> is generally sounded throughout
  England, 1. Each University contains a large number of the higher and
  better educated classes. 2. The members come from all parts of England
  indiscriminately. 3. Infinitely the majority come from schools; and some
  of the large schools have generally many members at each University. By
  such persons the pronunciation of the schools cannot fail to be
  represented. 4. Every one on entering the University is expected at least
  to know his own language. 5. There is no instruction, as far as I know
  (however much the fact may be to be regretted), ever given in English at
  either University. 6. There is a perpetual change of about a third of the
  members every year, few remaining above three years. Now can any one, who
  candidly considers these facts, doubt that a usage in pronouncing a
  particular word at <i>either</i> University if generally prevalent, is
  very strong evidence that the same usage is generally prevalent
  throughout England; but if any one does entertain such a doubt, surely it
  must be done away, when he finds that the same usage prevails at
  <i>both</i> Universities; though there exists such a degree of rivalry
  between them as would prevent the one from adopting from the other any
  usage which was liable to any the least doubt, and though there is no
  communication between them that could account for the same usage
  prevailing in both.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> appeals to the Prayer Book as a
  decisive authority, and instances "an <i>humble</i>," &amp;c. If any one
  will examine the Prayer Book, he will find that it is no authority at
  all; as "an" is at least as often used erroneously before <i>h</i> as
  not. In reading over the first sixty-eight Psalms, I found the following
  instances&mdash;Ps. xxvii. 3. and Ps. xxxiii. 15., "An host of men;" Ps.
  xlvii. 4. and Ps. lxi. 5., "An heritage;" Ps. xlix. 18., "An happy man,"
  Ps. lv. 5., "An horrible dread;" Ps. lxviii. 15., "An high hill." And in
  the same Psalms I only found <i>one</i> instance of <i>a</i> before
  <i>h</i>, viz. in Ps. xxxiii. 16., "A horse;" and in this case the Bible
  version has "An horse." In the first Lesson for the 19th Sunday after
  Trinity, Dan. iii. 4., "An herald," and 27., "An hair of their head,"
  occur; and in the next chapter (iv. 13.), "An holy one." It is plain from
  these instances (and doubtless many others may be found), that the use of
  "an" before <i>h</i>, in the Bible or Prayer Book, can afford no test
  whatever whether the <i>h</i> ought to be sounded or not.</p>

  <p class="author">S. G. C.</p>

  <p>After the sensible Note of your correspondent E.&nbsp;H., it is perhaps
  hardly necessary to say more on the subject of aspirated and mute
  <i>h</i>. If these remarks, therefore, seem superfluous, they may easily
  be suppressed, and that too without any offence to the writer. <!-- Page
  395 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>{395}</span></p>

  <p>It is very dangerous to dogmatise on the English language. We really
  have no authority to which we can confidently appeal, except the usage of
  good society: "Quem penes arbitrium est, et jus et norma loquendi."
  Unfortunately, however, every man is convinced, that in <i>his own</i>
  society that usage is to be found; and your correspondents, who have
  agreed in approving the <i>Heapian</i> pronunciation, will probably, on
  that ground, still retain the same opinion.</p>

  <p>The only words in the English language, in which <i>h</i> is written,
  but not pronounced, are words derived from Latin through the French; but
  of these, many in English retain the aspirate, though in French nearly
  all lose it. The exceptions collected by E.&nbsp;H. satisfactorily prove that
  we do not follow the French rule implicitly. They indeed carry the
  non-aspiration farther than to words of Latin derivation. They omit the
  aspirate to nearly all words derived from Greek. This we never do. I
  think that E.&nbsp;H.'s rule, of always aspirating <i>h</i> before <i>u</i>,
  is not entirely without exceptions. Except in Ireland, I never heard
  <i>humour</i> or <i>humorous</i> aspirated, though in <i>humid</i> and
  <i>humect</i> the <i>h</i> is always sounded. If this be right, it
  depends solely on the usage of good society, and not on rules laid down
  by Walker or Lindley Murray, whose authority we do <i>not</i> acknowledge
  as infallible. I may here remark, that no arguments can be drawn from our
  Liturgy or translation of the Bible that would not prove too much. If,
  because we find in our Liturgy "an <i>humble</i>, lowly, and obedient
  heart," we are to read "an <i>'umble</i>," we must also read "an 'undred,
  an 'ouse, an 'eap, an 'eart;" for <i>an</i> was prefixed in our Liturgy
  as well as in our translated Bible to <i>every</i> word beginning with
  <i>h</i>, and not (as one of your correspondents supposes) only to words
  beginning with silent <i>h</i>. Among young clergymen there is a growing
  habit (derived I suppose from Walker, or other such sources) of indulging
  in the <i>Heapian</i> dialect. I think Mr. Dickens will have done us more
  good by his ridicule, than will ever be effected by serious arguments;
  and I feel as much obliged to him as to E.&nbsp;H. To show how dangerous it is
  to be bound by a mere grammarian authority, a disciple of Vaugelas or
  Restaut (no insignificant names in French philology) would be led to read
  <i>les héros</i> as if it were "les zéros."</p>

<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 220.)</p>

  <p>I can answer <span class="sc">Mr. Weld Taylor</span> for at least one
  public school having no library, nor any books for other purposes than
  tasks, <i>i.e.</i> Christ's Hospital, London: whether any other
  metropolitan schools are provided with books I do not know. When I was at
  the above school, at all events, we had no books except for learning out
  of; whether reform has crept in since I was there, twenty-five years ago,
  I cannot say. I speak of then, not now.</p>

  <p>I remember very well a dusty cupboard with "Read, Mark, Learn,"
  painted in ostentatious letters on it. And these profound words were just
  like a park gate with high iron railings, where you may peep in and get
  no farther&mdash;no more could we: for we never saw the inside of it, and
  nobody could say where the key was, therefore what flowery
  <i>pleasaunce</i> of knowledge it contained nobody perhaps knows to this
  day. I also remember how greedily any entertaining book was borrowed,
  begged, and circulated; and thumbed and dog's-eared to admiration.
  <i>Rasselas</i> and <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, or
  <i>Sandford and Merton</i>, poor things! they became at last what might
  be supposed a public arsenal of umbrellas would at the last.</p>

  <p>When I reflect on that time, and the dreary winter's evenings,
  trundled to bed almost by daylight, my very heart sinks. What a luxury if
  some Christian had been allowed to read aloud for an hour, instead of
  lying awake studying the ghastly lamp that swung from the ceiling in the
  dormitory; or if some one with a modicum of information had given half an
  hour's lecture on some entertaining branch of science. Perhaps these
  antique schools are reformed in some measure, or perhaps they are waiting
  till their betters are.</p>

  <p>I observe, however, that certain parish work-house schools have,
  within these few days, taken the hint. Perhaps our public schools, for
  some are very wealthy, may be able to afford to follow their example.</p>

  <p>Marlborough College possesses a library of about four thousand
  volumes, entirely the munificent contribution of Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Geachy,
  one of the council. The boys of the fifth and sixth forms are allowed
  access daily at certain fixed hours, the librarian being present. In
  addition to this, libraries are now being formed in each house, which are
  maintained by small half-yearly subscriptions, and which will contain
  books of a more amusing character, and better suited for the younger
  boys.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;If this subject be not already
  exhausted, the following account of my method of preparing the material
  in question, which differs in some few important particulars from any I
  have seen published, may be of interest to some of my brother operators.
  <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page396"></a>{396}</span></p>

  <p>I have, after a very considerable number of experiments, succeeded in
  producing the <i>very highly</i> varnished appearance so conspicuous in
  some of the foreign proofs; and although I cannot say I admire it in
  general, more especially as regards landscapes, yet it is sometimes very
  effective for portraits, giving a depth of tone to the shadows, and a
  roundness to the flesh, which is very striking. Moreover, a photographer
  may just as well be acquainted with every kind of manipulation connected
  with the art.</p>

  <p>Having but a very moderate amount of spare time, and that at uncertain
  intervals, to devote to this seductive pursuit, I am always a great
  stickler for <i>economy of time</i> in all the processes, as well as for
  economy of material, the former with me having, perhaps, a shade more
  influence than the latter.</p>

  <p>As in all other processes, I find that the <i>kind of paper</i> made
  use of has a most important bearing upon the result. That which I find
  the best is of French manufacture, known as Canson Frères' (both the thin
  and the thick sorts), probably in consequence of their being sized with
  starch. The thin sort (the same as is generally used for waxed-paper
  negatives) takes the highest polish, but more readily embrowns after
  being rendered sensitive, and the lights are not ever quite so white as
  when the positive paper is used.</p>

  <p>In order to save both time and labour, I prepare my papers in the
  <i>largest</i> sizes that circumstances will admit of, as it takes little
  or no more time to prepare and render sensitive a large sheet than a
  small one; and as I always apply the silver solution by means of the
  glass rod, I find that a half-sheet of Canson's paper (being seventeen
  inches by eleven inches the half-sheet) is the best size to operate on.
  If the whole sheet is used, it requires <i>more</i> than double the
  quantity of solution to ensure its being properly covered, which
  additional quantity is simply so much waste.</p>

  <p>A most convenient holder for the paper whilst being operated upon, is
  one suggested by Mr. Horne of Newgate Street, and consists of a piece of
  half-inch Quebec yellow pine plank (a soft kind of deal), eleven inches
  by seventeen inches, screwed to a somewhat larger piece of the same kind,
  but with the grain of the wood at right angles to the upper piece, in
  order to preserve a perfectly flat surface. On to the upper piece is
  glued a covering of japanned-flannel, such as is used for covering
  tables, taking care to select for the purpose that which has no raised
  pattern, the imitation of rosewood or mahogany being unexceptionable on
  that account. The paper can be readily secured to the arrangement alluded
  to by means of a couple of pins, one at each of two opposite angles, the
  wood being sufficiently soft to admit of their ready penetration.</p>

  <p><i>To prepare the Albumen.</i>&mdash;Take the white of <i>one</i> egg;
  this dissolve in one ounce of distilled water, two grains of chloride of
  sodium (common salt), and two grains of <i>grape</i> sugar; mix with the
  egg, whip the whole to froth, and allow it to stand until it again
  liquefies. The object of this operation is to thoroughly incorporate the
  ingredients, and render the whole as homogeneous as possible.</p>

  <p>A variety in the resulting tone is produced by using ten grains of
  sugar of milk instead of the grape sugar.</p>

  <p>The albumen mixture is then laid on to the paper by means of a flat
  camel's-hair brush, about three inches broad, the mixture being first
  poured into a cheese plate, or other flat vessel, and all froth and
  bubbles carefully removed from the surface. Four longitudinal strokes
  with such a brush, if properly done, will cover the whole half-sheet of
  paper with an even thin film; but in case there are any lines formed, the
  brush may be passed very lightly over it again in a direction at right
  angles to the preceding. The papers should then be allowed to remain on a
  perfectly level surface until nearly dry, when they may be suspended for
  a few minutes before the fire, to complete the operation. In this
  condition the glass is but moderate, and as is generally used; but if,
  after the first drying before the fire, the papers are again subjected to
  precisely the same process, the negative paper will shine like polished
  glass. That is coated again with the albumenizing mixture, and dried as
  before.</p>

  <p>One egg, with the ounce of water, &amp;c., is enough to cover five
  half-sheets with two layers, or five whole sheets with one.</p>

  <p>I rarely iron my papers, as I do not find any advantage therein,
  because the moment the silver solution is applied the albumen becomes
  coagulated, and I cannot discover the slightest difference in the final
  result, except that when the papers are ironed I sometimes find flaws and
  spots occur from some carelessness in the ironing process.</p>

  <p>If the albumenized paper is intended to be kept for any <i>long</i>
  time before use, the ironing may be useful as a protection against
  moisture, provided the <i>iron be sufficiently hot</i>; but the
  temperature ought to be considerable.</p>

  <p>To render the paper sensitive, I use a hundred-grain solution of
  nitrate of silver, of which forty-five minims will exactly cover the
  sheet of seventeen inches by eleven inches, if laid on with the glass
  rod. A weaker solution will do, but with the above splendid tints may be
  produced. As to the ammonio-nitrate of silver, I have totally abandoned
  its use, and, after many careful experiments, I am satisfied that its
  extra sensitiveness is a delusion, while the rapid tendency of paper
  prepared with it to spoil is increased tenfold.</p>

  <p>The fixing, of course, modifies considerably the tone of the proof,
  but almost any desired shade <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page397"></a>{397}</span>may be attained by following the plan of
  <span class="sc">Mr. F.&nbsp;M. Lyte</span>, published in "N. &amp; Q.,"
  provided the negative is sufficiently intense to admit of a considerable
  degree of over-printing.</p>

  <p>It is a fact which appears to be entirely overlooked by many
  operators, that the <i>intensity</i> of the negative is the chief agent
  in conducing to black tones in the positive proof; and it is almost
  impossible to produce them if the negative is poor and weak: and the same
  observation applies to a negative that has been <i>over</i>-exposed.</p>

  <p><i>Cement for Glass Baths.</i>&mdash;The best I have tried is Canada
  balsam. My baths I have had in use five years, and have used them for
  exciting, developing hypo. and cyanide, and are as good as when first
  used.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Noxid.</span></p>

  <p><i>New Process for Positive Proofs.</i>&mdash;I have tried a method of
  preparing my paper for positive proofs, which, as I have not seen it
  mentioned as employed by others, and the results appear to me very
  satisfactory, I am induced to communicate to you, and to accompany by
  some specimens, which will enable you to judge of the amount of
  success.</p>

  <p>I use a glass cylinder, with air-pump attached, such as that described
  by <span class="sc">Mr. Stewart</span> as employed by him for iodizing
  his paper. I put in this the salt solution, and that I use is thus
  composed: 2 drachms of sugar of milk, dissolved in 20 ounces of water,
  adding&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Chloride of barium             15 grs.</p>
      <p>Chloride of sodium             15 grs.</p>
      <p>Chloride of ammonium           15 grs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In this I plunge several sheets of paper rolled into a coil (taking
  care that they are covered by the solution), and exhaust the air. I leave
  them thus for a few minutes, then take them out and hang them up to dry;
  or as the sheets are rather difficult to pin, from the paper giving way,
  spread them on a frame, across which any common kind of coarse muslin or
  tarletan, such as that I inclose, is stretched.</p>

  <p>I excite with ammonio-nitrate of silver, 30 grains to 1 ounce of
  water, applied with a flat brush.</p>

  <p>I fix in a bath of plain hypo. of the strength of one-sixth. The bath
  in which the inclosed specimens were fixed has been in use for some
  little time, and therefore has acquired chloride of silver.</p>

  <p>I previously prepared my paper by <i>brushing</i> it with the same
  salt solution, and the difference of effect produced may be seen by
  comparing a proof so obtained, which I inclose, with the others. This
  latter is of rather a reddish-brown, and not very agreeable tint. I have
  inclosed the proofs as printed on paper of Whatman, Turner, and Canson
  Frères, so as to show the effect in each case. The advantages which the
  mode I have detailed possesses are, I think, these:</p>

  <p>Greater sensitiveness in the paper,</p>

  <p>A good black tint, and</p>

  <p>Greater freedom from spots and blemishes, all very material
  merits.</p>

  certainly very satisfactory, the fifth is the one prepared by

  <p><i>The Groaning Elm-plank in Dublin</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  309.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span> has given an account of
  the groaning-board, one of the popular delusions of two centuries ago:
  the following notice of it, extracted from my memoir of Sir Thomas
  Molyneux, Bart., M.D., and published in the <i>Dublin University</i> for
  September, 1841, may interest your readers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In one of William Molyneux's communications he mentions the
  exhibition of 'the groaning elm-plank' in Dublin, a curiosity that
  attracted much attention and many learned speculations about the years
  1682 and 1683. He was, however, too much of a philosopher to be gulled
  with the rest of the people who witnessed this so-called 'sensible
  elm-plank,' which is said to have groaned and trembled on the application
  of a hot iron to one end of it. After explaining the probable cause of
  the noise and tremulousness by its form and condition, and by the sap
  being made to pass up through the pores or tubuli of the plank which was
  in some particular condition, he says: 'But, Tom, the generality of
  mankind is lazy and unthoughtful, and will not trouble themselves to
  think of the reason of a thing: when they have a brief way of explaining
  anything that is strange by saying, "The devil's in it," what need they
  trouble their heads about pores, and matters, and motion, figure, and
  disposition, when the devil and a witch shall solve the phenomena of
  nature.'"</p>

  what Taylor he refers to. Jeremy Taylor wrote a treatise on original sin;
  but he lived before Whiston. I have looked into two editions of the
  <i>Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin</i>, by John Taylor, one of Lond.
  1741, and another of Lond. 1750; but in neither of these can I find any
  mention of Mr. Whiston.</p>

  <p>"<i>When Orpheus went down</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 196. 281.).&mdash;In
  addition to the information given upon this old song by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Oldenshaw</span>, I beg to add the following. It was
  written for and sung <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page398"></a>{398}</span>by Mr. Beard, in a pantomimic
  entertainment entitled <i>Orpheus and Euridice</i>, acted at the theatre
  in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1740. The author of the entertainment was Mr.
  Henry Sommer, but the song in question was "translated from the Spanish"
  by the Rev. Dr. Samuel Lisle, who died Rector of Burclere, Hants, 1767.
  It was long very popular, and is found in almost all the song-books of
  the latter half of the last century. Mr. Park, the editor of the last
  edition of Ritson's <i>English Songs</i> (vol. ii. p. 153.), has the
  following note upon this song:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An answer to this has been written in the way of echo, and in defence
  of the fair sex, whom the Spanish author treated with such libellous
  sarcasm."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As this "echo song" is not given by Ritson or his editor, I have
  transcribed it from a broadside in my collection. It is said to have been
  written by a lady.</p>

  <p>In the parish church of Swarkestone in Derbyshire there is a monument
  to Richard Harpur, one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas in the
  reign of Elizabeth; on which he is represented in full judicial costume,
  with the collar of SS., which I am told by the minister of the parish is
  "distinctly delineated." It may be seen in Fairholt's <i>Costumes of
  England</i>, p. 278.</p>

  <p>As far as I am aware, this is the only instance, either on monuments
  or in portraits, of a <i>puisne</i> judge being ornamented with this
  decoration. Can any of your correspondents produce another example? or
  can they account, from any other cause, for Richard Harpur receiving such
  a distinction? or may I not rather attribute it to the blunder of the
  sculptor?</p>

  <p><i>Who first thought of Table-turning</i> (Vol. viii., p.

  was practised here three years ago, and, although sometimes associated
  with spirit-rappings, has more frequently served for amusement. On this
  connexion it may be proper to say that Professor Faraday's theory of
  unconscious muscular force meets with no concurrence among those who know
  anything about the subject in this country. It is notorious that large
  tables have been moved frequently by five or six persons, whose fingers
  merely touched them, although upon each was seated a stout man, weighing
  a hundred and fifty or sixty pounds: neither involuntary nor voluntary
  muscular force could have effected <i>that</i> physical movement, when
  there was no other <i>purchase</i> on the table than that which could be
  gained by a pressure of the tips of the fingers.</p>

  unsuccessful for the best of reasons, viz. that it does not exist there.
  He has probably borrowed it from some modern author, who, as it appears
  to me, has given a loose paraphrase of the words which I cited from
  <i>Thucyd.</i> <span class="scac">III.</span> 82., and has expanded the
  thought in a manner not uncommon with some writers, by adding the
  expression about the "sword and poniard." Some other misquotations of Sir
  A. Alison from the classical writers may be seen in the <i>Edinburgh
  Review</i> for April last, No. CXCVIII. p. 275.</p>

  <p><i>Origin of "Clipper" as applied to Vessels</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  100.).&mdash;For many years the fleetest sailing vessels built in the
  United States were <!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page399"></a>{399}</span>constructed at Baltimore. They were very
  sharp, long, low; and their masts were inclined at a much greater angle
  than usual with those in other vessels. Fast sailing pilot boats and
  schooners were thus rigged; and in the last war with England, privateers
  of the Baltimore build were universally famed for their swiftness and
  superior sailing qualities. "A Baltimore clipper" became the expression
  among shipbuilders for a vessel of peculiar make; in the construction of
  which, fleetness was considered of more importance than a carrying
  capacity. When the attention of naval architects was directed to the
  construction of swift sailing ships, they were compelled to adopt the
  clipper shape. Hence the title "Clipper Ship," which has now extended
  from America to England.</p>

  <p><i>Sincere</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 195. 328.).&mdash;The derivation of
  this word from <i>sine cerâ</i> appears very fanciful. If this were the
  correct derivation, we should expect to find <i>sinecere</i>, for the
  <i>e</i> would scarcely be dropped; just as we have the English word
  <i>sinecure</i>, which is the only compound of the preposition
  <i>sine</i> I know; and is itself <i>not a Latin word</i>, but of a later
  coinage. Some give as the derivation <i>semel</i> and <span title="keraô" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&#x1F71;&omega;</span>&mdash;that is, once mixed,
  without adulteration; the <span title="e" class="grk">&epsilon;</span>
  being lengthened, as the Greek <span title="akêratos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&kappa;&#x1F75;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>. The
  proper spelling would then be <i>simcerus</i>, and euphonically
  <i>sincerus</i>: thus we have <i>sim-plex</i>, which does not mean
  without a fold, but (<i>semel plico</i>, <span title="plekô" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&#x1F73;&kappa;&omega;</span>) once folded. So also
  <i>singulus</i>, semel and termination. The proper meaning may be from
  tablets, <i>ceratæ tabellæ</i>, which were "once smeared with wax" and
  then written upon; they were then <i>sinceræ</i>, without forgery or
  deception. If they were in certain places covered with wax again, for the
  purpose of adding something secretly and deceptively, they cease to be

  <p><i>The Saltpetre Man</i> (Vol. viii., p. 225.).&mdash;In addition to
  the curious particulars of this office, I send you an extract from Abp.
  Laud's <i>Diary</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"December 13, Monday. I received letters from Brecknock; that the
  <i>saltpeter man</i> was dead and buried the Sunday before the messenger
  came. This <i>saltpeter man</i> had digged in the Colledge Church for his
  work, bearing too bold upon his commission. The news of it came to me to
  London about November 26. I went to my Lord Keeper, and had a messenger
  sent to bring him up to answer that sacrilegious abuse. He prevented his
  punishment by death."</p>

  <p><i>Longevity</i> (Vol. viii., p. 182.).&mdash;<span class="sc">A

  authority for my statement respecting Mrs. Singleton, and her advanced
  age. If <span class="sc">A Doubter</span> is desirous of satisfying
  himself more fully respecting its correctness, he has but <!-- Page 400
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>{400}</span>to write to
  the above-named gentlemen, or to the English Consul at Charleston, S.&nbsp;C.,
  and his wish will doubtless be gratified. I cannot but hope that your

  <p>If <span class="sc">A Doubter</span> intends to be in New York while
  the present Exhibition is open, he will have an opportunity of seeing a
  negro of the age of <i>one hundred and twenty-four</i>, who once belonged

  information respecting the aged "nurse" of the first President of the
  United States mentioned in his note.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Virgil</i> (Vol. viii., p. 370.).&mdash;The passage for

      <p class="hg3">"Nunc scio quid sit Amor," &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Love Charm from a Foal's Forehead</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  292.).&mdash;Your correspondent H.&nbsp;P. will find the love charm,
  consisting of a fig-shaped excrescence on a foal's forehead, and called
  <i>Hippomanes</i>, alluded to by Juvenal, <i>Sat.</i> <span
  class="scac">VI.</span> 133.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hippomanes, carmenque loquar, coctumque venenum,</p>
      <p>Privignoque datum?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And again, 615.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"ut avunculus ille Neronis,</p>
      <p>Cui totam tremuli frontem Cæsonia pulli</p>
      <p>Infudit."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was supposed that the dam swallowed this excrescence immediately on
  the birth of her foal, and that, if prevented doing so, she lost all
  affection for it.</p>

  <p>However, the name Hippomanes was applied to two other things.
  Theocritus (<span class="scac">II.</span> 48.) uses it to signify some
  herb which incites horses to madness if they eat of it.</p>

  <p>And again, Virgil (<i>Geor.</i> <span class="scac">III.</span> 280.),
  Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, &amp;c., represent it as a certain
  <i>virus</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hippomanes cupidæ stillat ab inguine equæ."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The subject is an unpleasant one, and H.&nbsp;P. is referred for farther
  information to Pliny, <span class="scac">VIII.</span> 42. s. 66., and
  <span class="scac">XXVIII.</span> 11. s. 80.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p>This lump was called <i>Hippomanes</i>; which also more truly
  designated, according to Virgil, another thing. The following paragraphs
  from Mr. Keightley's excellent <i>Notes on Virgil's Bucolics and
  Georgics</i> will fully explain both meanings:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Hippomanes</i>, horse-rage: the pale yellow fluid which passes
  from a mare at that season [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> when she is horsing] (cf.
  <i>Tibul.</i> <span class="scac">II.</span> 4. 58.), of which the smell
  (<i>aura</i>, v. 251.) incites the horse.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vero nomine.</i> Because the bit of flesh which was said to be on
  the forehead of the new-born foal, and which the mare was supposed to
  swallow, was called by the same name (see <i>Æn.</i> <span
  class="scac">IV.</span> 515.); and also a plant in Arcadia
  (<i>Theocr.</i> <span class="scac">II.</span> 48.). With respect to the
  former Hippomanes, Pliny, who detailed truth and falsehood with equal
  faith, says (<span class="scac">VIII.</span> 42.) that it grows on the
  foal's forehead; is of the size of a dried fig (<i>carica</i>), and of a
  black colour; and that if the mare does not swallow it immediately, she
  will not let the foal suck her. Aristotle (<i>H.&nbsp;A.</i>, <span
  class="scac">VIII.</span> 24.) says this is merely an old wives' tale. He
  mentions, however, the <span title="pôlion" class="grk"
  >&pi;&#x1F7D;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>, or bit of livid flesh,
  which we call the foal's bit, and which he says the mare ejects before
  the foal."&mdash;<i>Notes, &amp;c.</i>, p. 273. on <i>Georgic.</i> <span
  class="scac">III.</span> 280. ff.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With regard to the plant called <i>Hippomanes</i>, commentators, as
  may be seen from Kiessling's note on Theocritus, ii. 48., are by no means
  agreed. Certainly Andrews, in his edition of Freund, is wrong in
  referring Virgil <i>Georgic.</i> <span class="scac">III.</span> 283. to
  that meaning. The use of <i>legere</i> probably misled.</p>

  <p><i>Wardhouse, where was?</i> (Vol. viii., p. 78.).&mdash;It probably
  is the same as Wardoehuus or Vardoehus, a district and town in Norwegian
  Finmark, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, inhabited principally by
  fishermen.</p>

  <p><i>Divining Rod</i> (Vol. viii., p. 293.).&mdash;The inquirer should
  read the statement made by Dr. Herbert Mayo, in his letters <i>On the
  Truths contained in Popular Superstitions</i>, 1851, pp. 3-21. To the
  facts there recorded I may add, that I have heard Mr. Dawson Turner
  relate that he himself saw the experiment of the divining rod
  satisfactorily carried out in the hands of Lady Noel Byron; and some
  account of it is to be found, I believe, in an article by Sir F.
  Palgrave, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="grk">&mu;</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle</i> (Vol. viii., p. 271.).&mdash;His arms
  are engraved on a plate dedicated to him by Willis, in his <i>Survey of
  the Cathedrals of England</i>, 1742, vol. i. p. 284., and appear thus,
  <i>Argent, on a chevron gules, three besants</i>; but in a MS. collection
  by the late Canon Rowling of Lichfield, relating to bishops' arms, I find
  his coat thus given,&mdash;<i>Argent, on a chevron engrailed gules, three
  besants</i>. The variation may have arisen from an error of the engraver.
  It appears from Willis that Dr. Waugh was a fellow of Queen's College,
  Oxford; and the entry of his matriculation would no doubt show in what
  part of England his family resided. He was successively Rector of St.
  Peter's, Cornhill; Prebendary of Lincoln; Dean of Gloucester; and Bishop
  of <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page401"></a>{401}</span>Carlisle; to which latter dignity he was
  promoted in August, 1723.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="grk">&mu;</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Pagoda</i> (Vol. v., p. 415.).&mdash;The European word pagoda is
  most probably derived, by transposition of the syllables, from
  <i>da-go-ba</i>, which is the Pali or Sanscrit name for a Budhist temple.
  It appears probable that the Portuguese first adopted the word in Ceylon,
  the modern holy isle of Budhism.</p>

  <p>DEAFNESS, CHRONIC OR ACUTE NERVOUS DEAFNESS, SINGING NOISES AND PAINS
  IN THE EARS.</p>

  <p>A NEW DISCOVERY FOR RESTORING HEARING, proved to be perfectly
  infallible, by which many thousands of sufferers have been instantly
  enabled to hear the human voice in a low tone without causing one
  instant's pain, inconvenience, or trouble to a child, or aged nervous
  sufferer of either sex. This truly important discovery for the cure of
  deafness, obviating as it does all the former dangerous and fatal
  operations, has been made by the eminent aurist, DR. DAVID THOMAS, ten
  years Consulting Surgeon, at 14. Stroud Street, Dover, the first
  application of which gives immediate relief, restoring the hearing in the
  most confirmed stages of deafness, whether from old age, nervousness, or
  any predisposing cause, to which children and adults are subject, and
  from which deafness follows the heavy affliction of noises in the head
  and ears, immediately removed by its use. Each sufferer can apply it
  himself: the proof and result being instantly convincing, as it enables
  the previously deaf person to hear common tone conversation, who before
  could only be made to hear by loud shouting in the ear, or by means of a
  powerful ear-trumpet. It has been applied by the Doctor on hundreds of
  suffering applicants at most of the ear infirmaries and hospitals, with
  perfect success, and in many thousands of cases to whom he has sent it
  many had not heard the human voice for half their life, and some not at
  all, who by its use alone are now perfectly restored to hearing and the
  society of their fellow-creatures, and enabled to hear distinctly in a
  place of worship.&mdash;Applicants who send a written statement of their
  case by letter, inclosing postage stamps or money order for 7<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i>, directed to DR. DAVID THOMAS, M.R.C.S.L., 14. Stroud Street,
  Dover, Kent, will receive the means of cure by return of post, with full
  directions for use. Personal consultation for deafness.</p>

  readers who are not extensively acquainted with mathematics. It conveys a
  general knowledge of the stupendous phenomena of nature, including all
  the modern discoveries down to the present time; directs those who
  possess telescopes how to use them, what objects to look for in the
  heavens, and where they are to be found; and gives familiar directions
  for the use and adjustment of the transit instrument, astronomical
  circle, and equatorial. It is peculiarly fitted for a text-book in
  schools, and is a good introduction for those who wish to obtain a
  knowledge of the present state of astronomical science.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
